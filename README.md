# D&D with Lee
## Web Development - Assignment 1

### Description
This is a html website that is to act as a resource for new players to find their footing in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. It is also a space where I can share my interests with others who share that same hobby.

The project overall was definitely a lot more work that I initially anticipated. It seemed that the closer I came to finishing one section, the more content I realised that I could add. So overall, I would say the site is not finished, in that I could continuously add more content to it.

### Navigation
For the most part, the site is easily navigated using the sidebar menu on the left-hand side. There are a few pages that can only be accessed from another page, to not make the menu too long, such as the articles linked on the content page, as well as contact link in the footer.

Example - Content:
![Content Page](https://github.com/OpinionatedHeron/HDip_Coursework/blob/main/images/content_page.png)

Regarding the content page, not all of grid cells contain a link to an article at the minute, as I already had many pages and was creating content myself. However, it shows how this site has room to expand and grow.

When clicking any of points with links - such as the social media icons and the resources, then content does not open in a new tab. I would recommend right-mouse-click New Tab so that you don't have to keep navigating back to the website.

Example - Socials:
![Socials](https://github.com/OpinionatedHeron/HDip_Coursework/blob/main/images/socials-image.png)
