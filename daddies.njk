				<p>
					Dungeons and Daddies is the perfect podcast for anyone who is not a stickler for the rules. Iâ€™ve been listening to this podcast for years and I am pretty sure that none of the players have ever bothered to learn the rules of the game. But that is what makes this podcast so enjoyable.

				<p>
					The first season of this show follows the misadventures of 4 dads from our world flung into the Forgotten Realms to rescue their missing sons. Rife with dad jokes and ridiculousness, this is the perfect podcast for anyone looking for a belly laugh. And to remind people that you can enjoy D&D without following the rules to the letter.
