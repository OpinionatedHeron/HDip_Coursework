				<p>
					Dimension 20 is one of my all-time favourite actual plays. It is easier to jump into than a lot of other shows because it runs short campaigns, rather than ongoing epics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is part of Dropout, which is a paid streaming service. It has a lot of other comedy content outside of Dimension 20 that make it well worth the money â€“ in my humble opinion. 
				</p>
				<p>
					However, if you would like to see if this is something you would enjoy before watching, their entire first campaign, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhOoxQxz2yFOcJoLoPRyYzjqCbddeOjP4">Fantasy High</a>, is available on YouTube.
